# NODE.JS

L1-> 
Node js installation -> even version is stable and can be work in production
                     -> Odd version is unstable as it is Beta version some changes there
                     -> node --version
                     -> npm(node package manager) -v 

L2-> 
NPM package-> we can use npm init to create dependencies and then we can set scripts and package
           -> NodeJS is for running server side application, so all DOM manipulation and other 
              frontend related applications are not present here.
